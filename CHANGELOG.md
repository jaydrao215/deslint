# Changelog

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-15

**MCP-first release.** Brings the `@deslint/mcp` server in line with the
current Anthropic MCP spec (2025-06-18), making Deslint a first-class
self-correction surface for Claude Code, Cursor, and Claude Desktop. The
core ESLint plugin and CLI are unchanged at the rule level — every existing
0.4.x project keeps the same lint output — so this is a safe, additive
upgrade for everyone, and the headline win for AI-assisted workflows.

### `@deslint/mcp`

- **MCP 2025-06-18 spec compliance.** Server now uses the modern
  `registerTool` API, advertises capabilities correctly, and returns typed
  `structuredContent` alongside the human-readable text block so agents
  can parse results without scraping stringified JSON.
  (`packages/mcp/src/server.ts`)
- **Tool annotations on every tool.** Each tool declares `readOnlyHint`,
  `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint`, so MCP clients
  can surface accurate consent prompts and skip redundant approvals for
  read-only operations. (`packages/mcp/src/tools.ts`)
- **`server.json` manifest** for MCP Registry submission. Lets the package
  be discovered and installed via the official MCP Registry under the
  reverse-DNS identifier `io.github.jaydrao215/deslint`.
  (`packages/mcp/server.json`)
- **Hardened path handling.** Path-traversal containment now uses
  `path.relative` instead of separator-string prefix matching, so it
  behaves correctly across macOS, Linux, and Windows.
  (`packages/mcp/src/server.ts`)
- **Resource caps.** Files > 10 MB are rejected; `analyze_project`,
  `compliance_check`, and `suggest_fix_strategy` clamp `maxFiles` to ≤ 5000
  per request. Prevents accidental memory exhaustion in large monorepos.

### Documentation & marketing

- **Landing reframe** around the AI-coding wedge. Hero is now "AI writes
  fast. Deslint keeps it clean.", subhead and proof chips emphasise the
  deterministic-check-in-the-agent-loop posture, and a new MCP loop section
  surfaces the self-correction story above the ESLint/CLI/Action lineup.
  (`apps/docs/src/components/{Hero,McpLoopSection,ProductShowcase}.tsx`)
- **Demo GIFs on every published README.** `@deslint/mcp`,
  `@deslint/cli`, and `@deslint/eslint-plugin` now show the product in
  motion at the top of their npm listing, served from the deslint.com CDN
  to keep tarball sizes flat.
  (`apps/docs/public/demo/{mcp-loop,cli-demo,vscode-squiggle}.gif`)
- **Pricing reframe.** Teams tier drops the misleading "Figma sync"
  marketing claim (the real Figma Variables → DTCG transform remains shipped
  in the free OSS CLI) and leads with the AI-PR design-debt dashboard wedge.
  Enterprise tier shifts from "Custom" to "From $10k / year · 20+ seats" so
  the page filters self-disqualifying conversations earlier.
  (`apps/docs/src/app/pricing/page.tsx`)

### `@deslint/eslint-plugin`, `@deslint/cli`, `@deslint/shared`

No rule-level changes. Versions bump in lockstep with `@deslint/mcp` per
the changeset `linked` config so the four packages always publish as a
matched set.

### Verification

- 1,480 tests passing (shared 125 · plugin 1,140 · cli 173 · mcp 25 ·
  action 17), zero regressions vs 0.4.0.
- End-to-end smoke against the compiled binaries on a dirty React sample:
  `deslint scan` correctly scored 40/100 with 8 violations; `deslint fix
  --all` applied 6 autofixes (`p-[7px]→p-1.5`, `mt-[19px]→mt-5`,
  `loading="lazy"` on `<img>`) and refused the 10 fixes that need human
  judgement.
- `node packages/mcp/demo/self-correction-loop.mjs` exercised the real
  stdio JSON-RPC path: `initialize` → `tools/list` (6 tools) → `analyze_file`
  (4 violations + autofix suggestions) → `analyze_and_fix` (corrected file
  returned, 2 fixed / 2 flagged for review).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-15

**Autofix that preserves your design.** A batch of 13 fixes that turn every
silent-rewrite autofix in 0.3 into an opt-in suggestion with reasoning.
Your design is preserved by default; riskier transforms are now explicit.

**All users on 0.3.x should upgrade.** None of the previous autofix
behaviours are gone — they're all still available, but behind
per-rule opt-in flags. If you were relying on `--fix` rewriting
everything silently, see *Behaviour changes* below.

### CLI fixes

- **Multi-fix passes no longer corrupt files.** `fixAll` /
  `fixInteractive` now apply multiple autofixes via a byte-exact replay
  against the original source, instead of re-parsing partially-fixed
  output. Fixes cases where a second fix would see a mangled token
  stream from the first and silently drop its edit.
  (`packages/cli/src/fix-apply.ts`)
- **`cwd` is forwarded through `fixAll` / `fixInteractive`.** ESLint
  resolves config files relative to `cwd`, so running `deslint fix` from
  a subdirectory now uses the right config. (`packages/cli/src/fix.ts`)
- **Monorepo leaf support.** `.deslintrc.json` is now found by walking
  upward from the target file, not just from `process.cwd()`. Leaf
  apps in a pnpm/turborepo workspace no longer require a local config
  copy. (`packages/cli/src/config-loader.ts`)
- **`deslint init` merges into existing `eslint.config.js`** instead of
  overwriting, and no longer auto-adds `deslint:fix` to `package.json`
  scripts (opt-in via `--with-scripts`). (`packages/cli/src/init.ts`)

### Rule fixes (autofix safety)

Every rule below previously rewrote code on `--fix`. In 0.4, the
rewrites still exist — but as *suggestions*, not silent autofixes —
except where the fix is guaranteed safe (exact token matches, explicit
opt-in, etc.).

- **`dark-mode-coverage`** — autofix is opt-in. The rule used to rewrite
  `bg-white` / `text-slate-900` across every file on `--fix`, shipping
  light-themed apps as dark ones. Now suggest-only by default; opt in
  with `{ autofix: true }` when your dark-mode token mapping is
  complete. (`packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/dark-mode-coverage.ts`)
- **`no-arbitrary-zindex`** — portal values are allowlisted. `z-[999]`,
  `z-[1000]`, `z-[9999]` no longer get clamped to `z-50`, so modals,
  toasts, and dropdowns stay above sticky headers. Allowlist is
  configurable via `exemptValues`.
  (`packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/no-arbitrary-zindex.ts`)
- **`no-arbitrary-colors`** — only autofixes *exact* `customTokens`
  matches. When a user has declared a token for a specific hex, we use
  it; when they haven't, we emit a suggestion with the nearest match
  instead of silently rewriting. Eliminates "why did my brand red turn
  into `bg-red-500`?" regressions.
  (`packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/no-arbitrary-colors.ts`)
- **`prefers-reduced-motion`** — `animate-spin` and `animate-ping` are
  exempt by default. Their motion IS the loading signal; wrapping them
  in `motion-safe:` leaves reduced-motion users looking at a static
  circle. Exempt list is configurable via `exemptClasses`.
  (`packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/prefers-reduced-motion.ts`)
- **`icon-accessibility`** — autofix is opt-in. Guessed `aria-label`
  values were frequently wrong (e.g. "close" for a kebab menu) and
  misled screen reader users. The rule still reports missing labels;
  the fix is suggest-only unless `{ autofix: true }` is set with an
  `iconLabels` map.
  (`packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/icon-accessibility.ts`)
- **`lang-attribute`** — only autofixes when `defaultLang` is
  configured. Previously stamped `lang="en"` on every `<html>` without
  asking, which broke sites in other languages and tripped
  WCAG 3.1.1 audits.
  (`packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/lang-attribute.ts`)
- **`responsive-image-optimization`** — priority-aware. `<img loading>`
  is no longer auto-set to `"lazy"` on images inside the first viewport
  or marked `priority`/`fetchPriority="high"`. LCP hero images stay
  eagerly loaded. (`packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/responsive-image-optimization.ts`)
- **`focus-trap-patterns`** — component allowlist for headless UI kits.
  Radix `<Dialog>`, Headless UI `<Dialog>`, and shadcn/ui `<Sheet>` are
  no longer flagged as missing focus traps — they implement focus
  trapping themselves. Configurable via `trustedComponents`.
  (`packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/focus-trap-patterns.ts`)

### Config schema

- **`ProfileSchema` is now strict.** Unknown keys in `.deslintrc.json`
  are rejected with a clear error instead of silently ignored, catching
  typos like `severity` vs `severities` at load time.
  (`packages/shared/src/config-schema.ts`)

### Behaviour changes

If you were relying on any of these autofix rewrites, add the opt-in flag
to the rule's options in your `eslint.config.js`:

```js
// Before (0.3): silent rewrite on --fix
// After (0.4): suggest-only, explicit opt-in
'@deslint/dark-mode-coverage': ['error', { autofix: true }],
'@deslint/icon-accessibility': ['error', { autofix: true, iconLabels: { /* ... */ } }],
'@deslint/lang-attribute': ['error', { defaultLang: 'en' }],
```

### Validated

- Full workspace test suite green (1,480+ tests across 5 packages).
- Typecheck clean across all packages.
- Action bundle verified in CI (PR #28).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-15

Correctness release. Fixes two bugs in v0.3.0 (and earlier) that produced
misleading results on TypeScript projects. **All users on 0.1.x–0.3.0 should
upgrade.** Older versions have been deprecated on npm.

### Fixed

- **`deslint init` did not configure the TypeScript parser.** Generated flat
  configs omitted `@typescript-eslint/parser`, so `.ts` / `.tsx` files failed
  to parse with "keyword 'interface' is reserved" and similar errors on every
  scan. `init` now injects the parser for TS/TSX overrides and adds
  `@typescript-eslint/parser` as a dependency where appropriate.
  (`packages/cli/src/init.ts`)
- **Design Health Score returned 100/100 when all files failed to parse.**
  The score calculation counted zero violations as "no problems found" even
  when the underlying files produced parse errors and were never analyzed.
  Score now returns an explicit unavailable state when parse failures
  prevent analysis, and the formatter surfaces this instead of rendering a
  misleading perfect score. Regression tests added.
  (`packages/cli/src/lint-runner.ts`, `packages/cli/src/formatters.ts`,
  `packages/cli/tests/score.test.ts`)

### Deprecated

- `@deslint/cli`, `@deslint/eslint-plugin`, `@deslint/mcp`, and
  `@deslint/shared` versions `<0.3.1` are deprecated on npm. Both bugs above
  were present in every prior release, so results from those versions on
  TypeScript projects should not be trusted.

### Validated

- Full workspace test suite green (~1,280+ tests).
- End-to-end scan on a real AI-generated Next.js + TypeScript project
  (`tracklance-freelancer-dashboard`): zero parse errors, 82/100 score,
  121 real design violations surfaced — previously reported as 100/100.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-09

The Accessibility Foundation release. Adds framework-agnostic infrastructure,
6 new WCAG-mapped a11y rules, plain HTML parser support, a widened WCAG 2.2 +
2.1 compliance evaluator, and a productionized MCP self-correction loop. Every
shipping rule now works across React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, and plain HTML.

### Added

- **6 new WCAG-mapped accessibility rules in `@deslint/eslint-plugin`:**
  - `heading-hierarchy` — WCAG 1.3.1 + 2.4.6 — flags skipped heading levels
    (`h1 → h3`) across single-page and multi-component hierarchies, with a new
    cross-element `onComplete` hook pattern for collect-then-evaluate analysis.
    Caught 4 real production bugs during dogfood on 3 real OSS projects.
  - `form-labels` — WCAG 1.3.1 + 3.3.2 — matches `<label htmlFor>` to `<input
    id>`, walks wrapping `<label>` ancestors, and treats PascalCase
    `<Input>`/`<TextField>` as opaque design-system components to avoid false
    positives.
  - `lang-attribute` — WCAG 3.1.1 — HTML-only, requires `lang` on root `<html>`.
  - `viewport-meta` — WCAG 1.4.4 (F77) — flags `user-scalable=no` and
    `maximum-scale=1` which block pinch-zoom. Dogfood caught and fixed a P1 bug
    where the CLI rule list was hard-coded and silently skipped this rule.
  - `link-text` — WCAG 2.4.4 (Link Purpose in Context) — flags generic link
    text (`click here`, `read more`, `here`, `more`). `linkComponents` option
    (default `['Link', 'NextLink']`) supports Next.js anchor abstractions.
    Caught 2 real production bugs in `shadcn-ui/taxonomy`.
  - `aria-validation` — WCAG 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value) — detects invalid roles,
    hallucinated `aria-*` attributes, and common LLM typos like `aria-labelby`,
    `aira-label`, `aria-pressd` with did-you-mean suggestions.
  - **Validation:** 731 file-rule combinations evaluated on 3 real OSS
    projects, 6 real bugs caught, 0 false positives.

- **Framework-agnostic element visitor abstraction:**
  - New `createElementVisitor()` in `packages/eslint-plugin/src/utils/` —
    sibling to the existing `createClassVisitor()` — emits a uniform
    `{ tagName, attributes, node, framework }` callback across React JSX,
    Angular `Element$1`, Vue `VElement`, Svelte `SvelteElement`, and plain
    HTML `Tag`.
  - Helpers: `getAttribute(node, name)`, `getStaticAttributeValue(attr)`,
    `hasSpreadAttribute(node)`, `isDecorative(element)`, plus the new
    cross-element `onComplete` hook for collect-then-evaluate rules.
  - `image-alt-text`, `missing-states`, and `responsive-required` ported from
    hand-rolled `JSXOpeningElement` selectors to the element visitor — now
    work cross-framework with no regression on the existing JSX test suites.

- **Plain HTML parser support:**
  - `@html-eslint/parser` added as an optional peer dep on
    `@deslint/eslint-plugin`. When installed, plain `.html` files route to
    html-eslint; Angular's template parser continues to own `.component.html`.
  - `@deslint/cli` flat config now loads `@html-eslint/parser` dynamically,
    with graceful fallback when the package isn't installed.
  - `createClassVisitor` gained a `Attribute[key.value="class"]` selector for
    html-eslint AST nodes.
  - Unblocks government, legal-tech, and regulated-industry codebases that
    ship plain HTML or server-rendered templates without Angular installed.

- **WCAG 2.2 + 2.1 compliance report widening (`@deslint/cli`):**
  - Evaluator now returns `byLevel` (per-level conformance using the same
    at-or-below logic as `levelReached`) and `wcag21` (an explicit
    `WCAG_21_CRITERIA_IDS` subset evaluated independently, not assumed from
    the 2.2 → 2.1 superset).
  - HTML report grouped into `Level A` and `Level AA` sections with separate
    conformance badges per level. New stat cards show WCAG 2.2 and WCAG 2.1
    AA side by side.
  - **ADA Title II framing** — new `wcag21-note` callout explicitly states
    that WCAG 2.1 AA is the ADA Title II technical standard and maps the
    evaluated subset for audit evidence.
  - All 6 new S4 rules mapped to WCAG criteria. Coverage expanded from 6 to
    13 evaluated criteria.

- **`@deslint/mcp` productionization:**
  - `analyzeFile` and `analyzeAndFix` now delegate to `@deslint/cli`'s
    `runLint` as the single source of truth. Fixes a stale 10-rule registry
    that blocked the S4 rules (and the three ported rules) from firing via
    MCP.
  - New `resolveProjectDir()` helper pivots `cwd` to the file's directory
    when the requested `projectDir` doesn't contain the file — fixes the
    ESLint v10 "File ignored because outside of base path" error for
    out-of-tree files.
  - `analyzeAndFix` now copies the target file to `mkdtempSync` scratch,
    runs `runLint({ fix: true })`, reads the diff, and deletes the scratch
    in `finally`. The workspace file is never touched.
  - New demo client at `packages/mcp/demo/self-correction-loop.mjs` — real
    JSON-RPC client that spawns the MCP server over stdio, walks
    `initialize → tools/list → analyze_file → analyze_and_fix`, and
    pretty-prints every protocol beat.

### Changed

- **Rule count: 14 → 20.** The 6 new a11y rules bring the shipping rule count
  to 20 across all categories. The recommended config enables all of them by
  default; the strict config upgrades 4 of the 6 to `error`.
- **Element visitor ports.** `image-alt-text`, `missing-states`, and
  `responsive-required` now use the element visitor. No behavioral change on
  JSX; adds React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, and plain HTML support from the
  same rule file.
- **CLI lint runner.** Rule registry is now the single source of truth
  (`packages/cli/src/lint-runner.ts`). Previously, the CLI and MCP had
  separate rule lists that drifted; they are now unified and the MCP
  delegates to the CLI.
- **Coverage thresholds.** Adjusted to honest enforced baselines (86% lines
  / 75% branches for `@deslint/eslint-plugin`) rather than the unenforced
  aspirational 95/90 from v0.1.x. Ratcheting strategy: targeted file-level
  tests, not big-bang sprints.

### Fixed

- **MCP rule registry drift.** The `@deslint/mcp` server shipped with a
  10-rule hard-coded list in v0.1.1, which silently skipped all S4
  accessibility rules and any rule added after the initial MCP write. Fixed
  by delegating to the CLI's `runLint`.
- **MCP "File ignored because outside of base path" error.** Users running
  the MCP against files outside the `projectDir` (common in Cursor's
  single-file analysis flow) got an ESLint v10 base-path error. Fixed via
  `resolveProjectDir()`.
- **CLI rule list hard-coding.** S4 dogfood revealed that `lint-runner.ts`
  had a hard-coded rule list that didn't include `viewport-meta` or
  `lang-attribute` despite both being registered in the plugin. Fixed by
  pulling directly from the plugin's `rules` export.
- **Heading hierarchy dogfood bug.** The S4 `heading-hierarchy` rule was
  dogfooded on `apps/docs` and immediately caught a real `h1 → h3` skip in
  the landing docs page. Fixed in the same commit that introduced the rule.
- **`form-labels` PascalCase false positive.** Initial v1 matched all
  `<Input>` regardless of case, producing FPs on Radix-based design
  systems. Fixed: JSX `<input>` is matched case-sensitively (lowercase
  only); PascalCase components are treated as opaque.
- **`link-text` scope too narrow.** Initial v1 only checked raw `<a>`, which
  returned 0 hits on every real Next.js project because they all use
  `<Link>`. Re-scoped to include `linkComponents` option.

### Engineering

- **Framework parity.** Of the 20 shipping rules, 14 are now fully
  framework-agnostic (up from 6 in v0.1.1). The remaining 6 are either
  inherently framework-specific (`lang-attribute`, `viewport-meta` on HTML)
  or still JSX-only pending v0.3.0 porting (`consistent-component-spacing`,
  `consistent-border-radius`, `max-component-lines`, `no-inline-styles`).
- **Test suite growth.** 792 tests in v0.1.1 → **1,145 tests in v0.2.0**
  (+353 tests). All green on Node 20 + 22.
- **New cross-element rule pattern.** The `onComplete` hook added to
  `createElementVisitor` enables rules that need to collect all elements
  of a type before evaluating (heading hierarchy, form label matching,
  aria attribute cross-validation). This pattern will underpin future
  cross-file analysis in v0.3.0.
- **Release workflow** idempotency — each publish step checks the npm
  registry first and skips if `name@version` is already published. Makes
  partial-publish failures (token scope, network blip) fully recoverable by
  re-running the workflow on the same tag.

### Validated

- **Dogfood coverage.** S4 rules validated on 3 real OSS projects
  (`shadcn-ui/taxonomy`, `leerob/next-saas-starter`, Vintor), 731 file-rule
  combinations evaluated, 6 real production bugs caught, 0 false positives.
- **End-to-end compliance dogfood.** `deslint compliance apps/docs/out` on
  the rebuilt Deslint landing page: **Level AA, 13/13 passing, 0 failing**
  on both WCAG 2.2 and the 2.1 subset.
- **Cross-framework smoke.** Visual-proof landing section tested across
  Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox via Playwright; all 4 beats render
  correctly on all 3 browsers.

### Not yet shipping (v0.3.0 roadmap)

- Porting the remaining 5 JSX-only rules (`consistent-component-spacing`,
  `consistent-border-radius`, `max-component-lines`, `no-inline-styles`,
  and `missing-states`'s Angular autofix) to full cross-framework parity.
- `focus-indicators`, `keyboard-navigation`, `skip-navigation`,
  `touch-target-size`, and `autocomplete-attribute` — considered for S4
  but deferred because the static-AST heuristics don't meet the 0% FP bar.
  Revisit once CSS scanning lands (Stage 2D).
- Cross-file design graph ("47 Buttons across 23 files, here's how they
  diverge") — KPMG Phase 2, post-v0.2.0.
